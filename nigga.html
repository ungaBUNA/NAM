<h2><u><b> Morning routine :</b></u> </h2>
<h3> I wake up at 6 AM in the morning . I brush my teeth and get ready to go to college . I go out of the house at 7 AM . I go by car with my friends . I arrive at college by 7:20 - 7:30 AM . I get a cup of tea with some of my other friends . At last , I enter the college at 8:00 AM . </h3>

<h2><u><b>College time :</b></u></h2>
<h3>After entering the college , I am met by all the racial slurs thrown at me by my so called friends . Even though I seem like I am used to the slurs , deep inside it still hurst . But nevertheless , I sit in the first bench . When the classes start , the teacher walks in and we all greet them . If it is a teacher I DON'T like , then I just sleep the whole class . Everyday we have 6 periods and 30 minutes of tiffin time . Every Sunday we have 2 practical classes . They are Physics and Chemistry . And there is also ICT and Biology practical classes also . Since I have Statistics as oen of my subjects , I don't need to attend Biology classes or practical classes . As I sttudy HTML and Java at home , I rarely attend ICT practical class .  The statistic students are mainly in Section 3 . I was in Section 1 as captain but after shifting to statistics I lost my position as captain . I really don't like a lot of teachers but I will not say their names . There are some teachers who I really like . My favourite teacher is Bhasha Ma'am . Even though I only got 2 of her classes she immediately became my facourite . HSC studies are a lto different then SSC studies . It feels like my studies increased by 5 times . But I will persivere and try my utmost to get the best results to not disappoint my parents even though they abuse me mentally everyday . But I still love my parents . I just need to deal with the racial slurs that I get but I am sure everything will turn out fine . Even if it doesn't , there is always the isekai way . </h3>
